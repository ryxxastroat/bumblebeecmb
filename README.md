# CMB code for the bumblebee gravity theory

Please see

R. Xu, and D. Xu, _Bumblebee cosmology: The FLRW solution and the CMB temperature anisotropy_

for reference.



**Units:** Geometrized (G=c=1) and H_0^{-1} taken as the unit length


**********specific parameters of each file**********

Coupling constant \xi = [0.8045, 1.811, 2.817]*8*\pi (as the names of the files suggest)

Mass of the solutions = [1.000, 1.000, 1.000] 

Bumblebee charge of the solutions = [1.186, 2.986, 4.447]
